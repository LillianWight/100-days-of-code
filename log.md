# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Joined 100 Days of Code after listening to Alex's podcast episode on The Stack Overflow. https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/07/24/podcast-255-alex-kallaway-100-days-of-code/

**Thoughts:** Overwhelmed and a bit anxious. I misunderstood when I thought my udemy time would count towards the hour. There are many channels to join and follow, a few more responsibilities than I expected. I looked at my options and saw: 1. I could follow the lessons at FreeCodeCamp; 2. I could code HTML and CSS, since I 'know' them already.

### Day 1: July 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Uploaded DesignSample to GitHub. Had to separate it from Web Design folder. Learned (again) about the .git file that results from initializing the repository, then had to fix a problem where even after creating the Repo on GitHub VSCode wouldn't push the files. Kept getting an error about no remote. Found a StackOverflow answer about remotes, finally fixed it and pushed the files.

**Thoughts**: It may not have been a coding exercise but I'm counting it towards my hour because GitHub is so important to development. Still, I don't feel comfortable or confident.

### Day 2: July 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the JavaScript IMAP code, trying to get it to work with the configurations provided by the email host. I returned to facesofcovid.net and added a notice about demo photos and started renaming some classes to make them more semantic and to organize them so fewer of them would have to be changed for different photos. Dario's demo is broken now so I will fix it tomorrow.

**Thoughts** I thought about quitting twice today. It still feels unnatural and overwhelming.

### Day 3: July 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I spent an hour doing exercise 1a of the Chapter 8 labs from https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-to-program-with-java-2/. First I couldn't think how to write the program (I was over-complicating it); then I had trouble creating a repo for it at GitHub. When I included the 'package' line in VSCode like I do when I write Java using Notepad++ it caused all kinds of locating issues. The fix suggestion was to create the location, which I did - but that just put a "labs" folder within the "labs" folder where I had located the Mult2.java file in the first place. I fixed that, then when I got the error again I took the suggestion to just delete the 'package' line. Looks like I haven't learned everything there is to know about starting a Java file, OR it's something special with VSCode.
VSCode wouldn't execute the code exactly as I wanted: I kept trying to make the program output a blank line before and after the numbers output but no matter what I tried it just wouldn't output a blank line before the numbers output without also outputting a line between each of the numbers. I eventually gave up trying.

It seems I have some super-fundamental stuff to learn about Java programming and I have to review the section of https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-visual-studio-code/ on Source Control and GitHub, plus I'll have to take https://www.udemy.com/course/git-and-github-crash-course/ to get a better feel for GitHub as I don't understand all of what I'm seeing after creating a new Repo directly at the site.


**Thoughts**
I have enough knowledge to cause myself anxiety at this point. I sure hope that at the end of the 100 days I can look back at this and laugh.
