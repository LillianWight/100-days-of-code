# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 11: August 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I spent just about an hour following tonight's #100DaysOfCodeChats, which was about mentors. While participating on Twitter, I started looking over my code for facesofcovid.net so that I could figure out why the memory popup isn't displaying correctly. It's been a month since I've looked at it so it felt foreign and unfamiliar. I used DevTools but I haven't figured out the problem yet. I'm determined to spend some serious time making the fixes until they're done. I want very much to be able to start promoting the site to potential users.

**Thoughts**
Staying away from a language is a bad idea when I'm this new. It becomes unfamiliar very quickly. I have decided to spend a little time with Java *and* with HTML/CSS each day.

### Day 10: August 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Spent a couple of hours completing two more exercises from the udemy.com class (https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-to-program-with-java-2/). I took the EmployeeMenu program further than I had to, spending significant time developing and refining if/else if/else statements.

**Thoughts**
The exercises went very well. Syntax/structure are so critical to proper execution of Java and I am excited that I got so much nested stuff right (after a little reading).

### Day 9: August 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Spent a few hours making my way through four more exercises. This time I figured out more than I didn't, but not by as wide a gap as I'm aiming for. I pushed four programs to GitHub today.

**Thoughts**
Today was much better. I know I've improved my understanding by a significant margin.

### Day 8: August 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Again spent a couple of hours trying to solve Exercise 6. Did research via Google, looked at my notes, looked at previous programs, even ended up posting on r/javahelp. My solution's flaw was in my while statement, which I have now learned how to write when trying to create a 'false' condition. I have uploaded two versions of the program; v2 is the one I was trying to do but couldn't without help. I tackled Exercise 7 but quickly (relatively) acknowledged that I wasn't going to be able to do it. I was trying to find a way to turn integers (the iteration count) into characters (the asterisks we were to print). Seeing the solution taught me how much I have to learn to visualize the desired result before I tackle it. It also taught me a little more about Java's capabilities.

**Thoughts**
Once again I've made mistakes to learn. I've also seen something I couldn't have imagined before. I had moments of thinking I would have to surrender but I'm too excited by what I've seen to quit.

### Day 7: August 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Spent two hours trying to do the exercise. Finally gave up and watched Jamie's solution. Even then I kept making a mistake: I would compile the right program as I made changes but I kept running a previous program with a similar name. It took me too long to see my mistake.

**Thoughts**
Disaster. Huge setback to confidence. I've been here before, thinking I won't be able to do it. It's going to be a longer, harder road for me than it is for most people. I will make every mistake there is to make, and that will make me a subject matter expert. In the meantime, I currently suck.

### Day 6: July 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: While working on the Chapter 8 Lab exercise #4 from https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-to-program-with-java-2/, I mistyped num++ and factor++ and made them num = num++ and factor = factor++, respectively, inadvertently causing an infinite loop. I read a StackOverflow answer (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26510679/the-difference-between-num-vs-num) and watched Jamie's solution before I realized what I'd done.

**Thoughts**
Oops.

### Day 5: July 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on the Chapter 8 exercises from https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-to-program-with-java-2/. I also learned to correct a GitHub commit message (https://docs.github.com/en/github/committing-changes-to-your-project/changing-a-commit-message)

**Thoughts**
My Fibonacci-related programs were pretty much exactly the same as Jamie's! I am very proud of myself and very excited that I did this on my own.

### Day 4: July 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on the Chapter 8 exercises from https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-to-program-with-java-2/.

**Thoughts**
Math is an obstacle; I don't have the imagination for it.

### Day 3: July 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I spent an hour doing exercise 1a of the Chapter 8 labs from https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-to-program-with-java-2/. First I couldn't think how to write the program (I was over-complicating it); then I had trouble creating a repo for it at GitHub. When I included the 'package' line in VSCode like I do when I write Java using Notepad++ it caused all kinds of locating issues. The fix suggestion was to create the location, which I did - but that just put a "labs" folder within the "labs" folder where I had located the Mult2.java file in the first place. I fixed that, then when I got the error again I took the suggestion to just delete the 'package' line. Looks like I haven't learned everything there is to know about starting a Java file, OR it's something special with VSCode.
VSCode wouldn't execute the code exactly as I wanted: I kept trying to make the program output a blank line before and after the numbers output but no matter what I tried it just wouldn't output a blank line before the numbers output without also outputting a line between each of the numbers. I eventually gave up trying.

It seems I have some super-fundamental stuff to learn about Java programming and I have to review the section of https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-visual-studio-code/ on Source Control and GitHub, plus I'll have to take https://www.udemy.com/course/git-and-github-crash-course/ to get a better feel for GitHub as I don't understand all of what I'm seeing after creating a new Repo directly at the site.


**Thoughts**
I have enough knowledge to cause myself anxiety at this point. I sure hope that at the end of the 100 days I can look back at this and laugh.

### Day 2: July 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the JavaScript IMAP code, trying to get it to work with the configurations provided by the email host. I returned to facesofcovid.net and added a notice about demo photos and started renaming some classes to make them more semantic and to organize them so fewer of them would have to be changed for different photos. Dario's demo is broken now so I will fix it tomorrow.

**Thoughts** I thought about quitting twice today. It still feels unnatural and overwhelming.

### Day 1: July 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Uploaded DesignSample to GitHub. Had to separate it from Web Design folder. Learned (again) about the .git file that results from initializing the repository, then had to fix a problem where even after creating the Repo on GitHub VSCode wouldn't push the files. Kept getting an error about no remote. Found a StackOverflow answer about remotes, finally fixed it and pushed the files.

**Thoughts**: It may not have been a coding exercise but I'm counting it towards my hour because GitHub is so important to development. Still, I don't feel comfortable or confident.

### Day 0: July 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Joined 100 Days of Code after listening to Alex's podcast episode on The Stack Overflow. https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/07/24/podcast-255-alex-kallaway-100-days-of-code/

**Thoughts:** Overwhelmed and a bit anxious. I misunderstood when I thought my udemy time would count towards the hour. There are many channels to join and follow, a few more responsibilities than I expected. I looked at my options and saw: 1. I could follow the lessons at FreeCodeCamp; 2. I could code HTML and CSS, since I 'know' them already.
