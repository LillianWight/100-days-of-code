# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Joined 100 Days of Code after listening to Alex's podcast episode on The Stack Overflow. https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/07/24/podcast-255-alex-kallaway-100-days-of-code/

**Thoughts:** Overwhelmed and a bit anxious. I misunderstood when I thought my udemy time would count towards the hour. There are many channels to join and follow, a few more responsibilities than I expected. I looked at my options and saw: 1. I could follow the lessons at FreeCodeCamp; 2. I could code HTML and CSS, since I 'know' them already.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
