# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Joined 100 Days of Code after listening to Alex's podcast episode on The Stack Overflow. https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/07/24/podcast-255-alex-kallaway-100-days-of-code/

**Thoughts:** Overwhelmed and a bit anxious. I misunderstood when I thought my udemy time would count towards the hour. There are many channels to join and follow, a few more responsibilities than I expected. I looked at my options and saw: 1. I could follow the lessons at FreeCodeCamp; 2. I could code HTML and CSS, since I 'know' them already.

### Day 1: July 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Uploaded DesignSample to GitHub. Had to separate it from Web Design folder. Learned (again) about the .git file that results from initializing the repository, then had to fix a problem where even after creating the Repo on GitHub VSCode wouldn't push the files. Kept getting an error about no remote. Found a StackOverflow answer about remotes, finally fixed it and pushed the files.

**Thoughts**: It may not have been a coding exercise but I'm counting it towards my hour because GitHub is so important to development. Still, I don't feel comfortable or confident.

### Day 2: July 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the JavaScript IMAP code, trying to get it to work with the configurations provided by the email host. I returned to facesofcovid.net and added a notice about demo photos and started renaming some classes to make them more semantic and to organize them so fewer of them would have to be changed for different photos. Dario's demo is broken now so I will fix it tomorrow.

**Thoughts** I thought about quitting twice today. It still feels unnatural and overwhelming.
