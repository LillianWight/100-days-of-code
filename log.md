# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Joined 100 Days of Code after listening to Alex's podcast episode on The Stack Overflow. https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/07/24/podcast-255-alex-kallaway-100-days-of-code/

**Thoughts:** Overwhelmed and a bit anxious. I misunderstood when I thought my udemy time would count towards the hour. There are many channels to join and follow, a few more responsibilities than I expected. I looked at my options and saw: 1. I could follow the lessons at FreeCodeCamp; 2. I could code HTML and CSS, since I 'know' them already.

### Day 1: July 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Uploaded DesignSample to GitHub. Had to separate it from Web Design folder. Learned (again) about the .git file that results from initializing the repository, then had to fix a problem where even after creating the Repo on GitHub VSCode wouldn't push the files. Kept getting an error about no remote. Found a StackOverflow answer about remotes, finally fixed it and pushed the files.

**Thoughts**: It may not have been a coding exercise but I'm counting it towards my hour because GitHub is so important to development. Still, I don't feel comfortable or confident.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
